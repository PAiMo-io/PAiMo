# PAiMO for üè∏

Welcome to the PIV Club's not-so-serious game scheduler. It's a Next.js app with NextAuth sprinkled on top so you can manage who gets to do what.

## Dangerously Quick Setup
1. Clone this repo and run `npm install`. (Skip this and things will break, we warned you!)
2. Drop a `.env.local` file at the project root with your `DB_URL`, a `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and variables for email verification:
   ```env
   DB_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
   AUTH_SECRET=some_complex_secret
   NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
   RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_key
   EMAIL_FROM=PAiMO <hello@paimo.io>
   ```
3. Fire up the dev server with `npm run dev` and open `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Head to `/signup` to create an account, then `/login` to start planning.

That's it. Short, sweet, and probably unstable‚Äîhandle with care!

## Generating Test Data
Need some dummy accounts fast? Use the `createTestData` script to seed the
database. Make sure your `.env.local` has `DB_URL` configured, then run:

```bash
node scripts/createTestData.js <user-count> [club-name] [event-name]
```

- `user-count` ‚Äì how many users to create
- `club-name` *(optional)* ‚Äì name of the club, default is **Test Club**
- `event-name` *(optional)* ‚Äì name of the event, default is **Test Event**

The script creates the users, a club, an event and registers everyone to that
event automatically.
